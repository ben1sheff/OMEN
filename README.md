# OMEN
Optical Metrology ENgine with GUI, designed for use in the Optics group at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab. The engine was designed for data from an Autocollimator-Based Long Trace Profiler, a high-precision mirror slope measurement device. It provided a GUI to visualize the mirror profiles and easily manipulate the data. Included a number of data manipulation techniques, includeing filtering, building, and applying calibration curves, and stitching together partial scans of the mirrors.

Included scipy, numpy, pyqt4, and pyqtgraph dependencies due to issues on some computers.

Later note: This has admittedly fallen out of date and is no longer supported. PyQTGraph had fallen into obsolescence at some point, although it may have been revived. User beware on that front.
