# OMEN
optical metrology engine with GUI. Included scipy, numpy, pyqt4, and pyqtgraph dependencies due to issues on some computers.

Later note: This has admittedly fallen out of date and is no longer supported. PyQTGraph had fallen into obsolescence at some point, although it may have been revived. User beware on that front.
